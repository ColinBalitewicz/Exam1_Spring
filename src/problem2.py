    What comes in:
          -- a string of characters
        What goes out:
          Nothing
        Side effects:
        Prints, in this order, on separate lines,
      -- The string entered by the user
      -- The length of the string entered by the user
      -- The number of alphabetic characters in the string
      -- The number of digits in the string
      -- The reverse string entered by the user
      -- If the string is a palindrome - it prints, the user entered a
      -- palindrome
      -- If the string is not a palindrome - it prints, the user entered a
      -- normal string
      Nothing else should be printed.

        Examples:
          See the TEST cases for examples.
        Type hints:
          :type string_of_characters: string

    A palindrome is a phrase that reads the same backwards. For example,
    the words eye, madam are palindromes because they read the same
    backwards.

    To implement this function, you need to reverse a string. If you write
    your own method to reverse a string and solve the entire problem, you
    will get 35 points. If you use the provided method
    reverseString(string), you will get 30 points

    Here are some examples:
       string_of_characters = 'eye'
       eye
       3
       3
       0
       eye
       The user entered a palindrome

       string_of_characters = 'abc1cba'
       abc1cba
       7
       6
       1
       abc1cba
       The user entered a palindrome

       string_of_characters = 'a12b'
       a12b
